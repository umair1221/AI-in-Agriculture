A taxonomy of AI applications in *agriculture* divided into three domains: *crops*, *livestock*, and *fisheries*. We highlight various ML tasks for each domain along with the domain-specific challenges. Furthermore, a detailed overview of common datasets in each domain is specified, along with different approaches used, ranging from conventional ML methods to foundation models.
