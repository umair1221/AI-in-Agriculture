## 1.‚ÄÇWhat is this repository?
This repository complements our survey paper, **‚ÄúAI in Agriculture: A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for Crops, Fisheries and Livestock‚Äù**, which is a comprehensive review of machine and deep-learning techniques for (A) crops, (B) fisheries, and (C) livestock domain. It provides readers with:
- a curated index of **200+ referenced papers**;
- high-resolution artwork (taxonomy diagrams, dataset examples, etc.);
- guidelines for contributing new references once the survey is published.

<!--   <img src="./Images/methods.jpg" width="45%" height="50%" /> -->
</p>


The goal is to make it effortless for researchers, practitioners and students to navigate the literature, replicate our analyses and extend the survey as the field evolves. The Pie chart represents the distribution of papers discussed in this survey under four methodological categories (CM: Conventional Methods, CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks, ViTs: Vision Transformers, FMs: Foundational Models). Each domain‚Äôs angular span is proportional to its total paper count, and each inner slice‚Äôs radial extent encodes the method‚Äôs share within that domain in this survey.

## üåê Cross-cutting Challenges & Opportunities

Across crops, fisheries and livestock domains, there are common hurdles and emerging openings:

### 1. Data Availability & Quality  
- **Challenge:** Sparse, imbalanced or noisy datasets; lack of standardized annotation protocols.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Establish open benchmarks and shared annotation guidelines  
  - Leverage synthetic data generation (GANs, simulation) to augment scarce classes  

### 2. Model Generalization & Transferability  
- **Challenge:** Models trained on one crop/region often fail to adapt elsewhere.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Domain‚Äëadaptation techniques (e.g. adversarial learning)  
  - Few‚Äëshot and meta‚Äëlearning to rapidly tune to new species or environments  

### 3. Multi‚Äëmodal Integration  
- **Challenge:** Disparate data streams (RGB imagery, hyperspectral, IoT sensors, weather).  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Fusion frameworks that co‚Äëlearn from images, time‚Äëseries and text  
  - Pretrained foundation models (CLIP, DINO) as backbones  

### 4. Scalability & Edge Deployment  
- **Challenge:** Resource‚Äëintensive models hinder real‚Äëtime, on‚Äëdevice inference.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Model compression (pruning, quantization)  
  - TinyML for low‚Äëpower, in‚Äëfield devices  

### 5. Explainability & Trust  
- **Challenge:** ‚ÄúBlack‚Äëbox‚Äù predictions limit farmer adoption and regulatory approval.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Interpretable architectures (attention maps, prototype networks)  
  - Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop tools for interactive validation  

### 6. Socio‚Äëeconomic & Ethical Considerations  
- **Challenge:** Equity gaps in technology access, data privacy, environmental impact.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Participatory sensing with local communities  
  - Policies and open‚Äëdata licenses that balance innovation and privacy  

### 7. Climate Resilience & Sustainability  
- **Challenge:** Rapidly changing environmental conditions undermine static models.  
- **Opportunity:**  
  - Continual learning systems that adapt to weather anomalies  
  - Digital‚Äëtwin simulations for ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù scenario planning
